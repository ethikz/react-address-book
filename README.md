## Address Book

This is my attempt to create an address book web app. 

I am learning react so I started with that but then it turns out there is something very similar to what I was trying to accomplish and so I used that boilerplate and felt like I kind of cheated.

With that feeling I decided to use simple jQuery and lodash to accomplish the task until I can learn more about Reactjs.

You can see the lodash app in the `lodash` folder.  The same goes for the react app, it is in the `react` folder, although this one is still a work in progress.

The react app doesn't have sorting yet.
