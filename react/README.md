## Setup Instructions

If you don't have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed then you need to download it first by clicking on the link.

Once downloaded then follow the steps below

**1**) Open terminal from the directory of the app and type:

```
npm install
```

**2**) After everything has installed just type:

```
gulp
```


**3**) The live reload server runs on [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)

If the port needs to change go to line ***156*** in the gulpfile.js



## Editing

All source files are in ```app```


##### NPM
If you need to add a gulp package then you should edit ```gulpfile.js``` and then stop the server and re-run:
```
gulp
```
